# ClassificationCNN

- This neural network is intended for the parking lot app
- The current network that we will test is found from this website https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/deep_cnn
  - Origionally it classified images into the following categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship and truck
    - Remarks: 
      - it does not have a category that will do pickup trucks ( if that becomes a problem we will work on a different network)
      - automobiles do not overlap with trucks
  - We have discarded all categories except automobile and truck
    - We will either add a category called not car or output that the spot is empty when the system is not very confident there is a car
  - It also has a peak performance of 86% accuracy but that might improve in our case
  - The model follows the architecture described by Alex Krizhevsky, with a few differences in the top few layers.
  - The layers are currently (in order):
    - convolutional layer
    - max pooling layer
    - normalization layer
    - convolutional layer
    - normalization layer
    - max pooling layer
    - fully connected layer with rectified linear activation
    - fully connected layer with rectified linear activation
    - softmax linear transformation to produce logits
  - We will train several networks to see what works best for our project
  - One network will be :
    - Convolutional layer
    - max pooling layer
    - normalization layer
    - fully connected layer with rectified linear activation
    - softmax linear transformation to produce logits
  - Another will be:
    - convolutional layer
    - fully connected layer with rectified linear activation
    - softmax linear transformation to produce logits
  - Another will be:
    - convolutional layer
    - max pooling layer
    - normalization layer
    - convolutional layer
    - fully connected layer with rectified linear activation
    - softmax linear transformation to produce logits
 - Things we will compare include: 
  - accuracy
  - learning rate
  - total loss
